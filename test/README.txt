## Unit tests for client side ##

In this directory, unit tests codes are supplied.
They contain unit tests for components for your convenience.
We recommend you effectively use them as clues for the component development.

In this exam, you don't need to pass all the tests; we don't care if some or all of the tests will fail.
You may freely add and remove tests if needed (you may even empty any tests).
We evaluate your assignment mainly on the viewpoint of the screen specs and the violation of the rules in your code.

# Note that this is *ONLY FOR* this examination.
# When you develop HUE, you must pass every test and should not remove failed tests.
# If the test codes won't match to your code implementation, never forget to rewrite test codes properly.
